This is the code repository for [Accelerate Model Training with PyTorch 2.X](https://www.packtpub.com/product/accelerate-model-training-with-pytorch-2x/9781805120100), published by Packt.

**Build more accurate models by boosting the model training process**

## What is this book about?
This book will help you use a set of optimization techniques and strategies to speed up the training process of ML models. You’ll learn how to identify performance bottlenecks, decide the most suitable approach, and implement the correct solution.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Compile the model to train it faster
* Use specialized libraries to optimize the training on the CPU
* Build a data pipeline to boost GPU execution
* Simplify the model through pruning and compression techniques
* Adopt automatic mixed precision without penalizing the model's accuracy
* Distribute the training step across multiple machines and devices

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter06.

The code will look like the following:
```
config_list = [{
    'op_types': ['Linear'],
    'exclude_op_names': ['layer4'],
    'sparse_ratio': 0.3
}]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for intermediate-level data scientists who want to learn how to leverage PyTorch to speed up the training process of their machine learning models by employing a set of optimization strategies and techniques. To make the most of this book, familiarity with basic concepts of machine learning, PyTorch, and Python is essential. However, there is no obligation to have a prior understanding of distributed computing, accelerators, or multicore processors.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
## Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-11 | PyTorch 2.X | Windows, Linux, or macOS |

To enhance your experience, we recommend executing the code on a system equipped with an NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA support and ensure that you run the code in a suitable environment with all the necessary libraries and moudles installed.
