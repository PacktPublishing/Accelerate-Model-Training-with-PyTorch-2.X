## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter06.

The code will look like the following:
```
config_list = [{
    'op_types': ['Linear'],
    'exclude_op_names': ['layer4'],
    'sparse_ratio': 0.3
}]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for entry-level data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to learn how to leverage PyTorch to speed up the training process of their deep learning models by employing a set of optimization strategies and techniques. To make the most of this book, familiarity with basic concepts related to deep Learning and Python language is essential. Prior knowledge of PyTorch, though useful, is not a prerequisite.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
## Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-11 | PyTorch 2.X | Windows, Linux, or macOS |

To enhance your experience, we recommend executing the code on a system equipped with an NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA support and ensure that you run the code in a suitable environment with all the necessary libraries and moudles installed.
